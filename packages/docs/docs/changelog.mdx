# Changelog

<!--
## 1.1.12 (2.0.0?) - DATE

### Features
- Upgraded library to React 18.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Improved how "select up to" (i.e. shift+clicking) works, to match how users would expect it to work. The user can
  now create multiple distinct selection ranges by clicking and shift-clicking another item, then control clicking
  a different item and shift+control clicking a forth item.

### Other Changes

- Added linter rules from airbnb config and fixed relevant issues. This fixed some memoization imperfections, which
  should improve performance.
- (Finally) added integration tests. This will ease the future development and help reduce regressions.
