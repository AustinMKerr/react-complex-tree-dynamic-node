## 2.0.0 - 12/05/2022

### Breaking Changes
- Replaced `item.hasChildren` property with `item.isFolder`
- Replaced `environment.canDropOnItemWithChildren` property with `environment.canDropOnFolder`
- Replaced `environment.canDropOnItemWithoutChildren` property with `environment.canDropOnNonFolder`
- Replaced CSS classes related to `hasChildren` with `isFolder`, e.g. `rct-tree-item-li-hasChildren` to `rct-tree-item-li-isFolder`

Note: These properties were just renamed, but the functionality is the same. `hasChildren` has
always denoted whether an item is a folder or not, which confused a lot of people and was admittedly
very bad naming. The new name is a better reflection of its functionality. The other two properties
were renamed alongside to match.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Upgraded library to React 18.
- Improved how "select up to" (i.e. shift+clicking) works, to match how users would expect it to work. The user can
  now create multiple distinct selection ranges by clicking and shift-clicking another item, then control clicking
  a different item and shift+control clicking a forth item.
- The function `treeItemActions.selectUpTo()` now accepts an optional boolean argument determining whether
  the previous selection range should be cleared before selecting the new range.
- Removed unnecessary memoization for event handlers, favoring stable callbacks stored in refs instead.
- Fixed a bug where renaming an item would make the page loose focus of the active tree.
- Items can now be dropped on empty trees. The tree container will need to be rendered with a minimum height for this
  to work, in the default renderers the container will now render with a minimum height of 30px, which can be adjusted
  in custom renderers.
- Fixed a bug where renaming from item renderer context was not working.

### Other Changes

- Added linter rules from airbnb config and fixed relevant issues. This fixed some memoization imperfections, which
  should improve performance.
- (Finally) added integration tests. This will ease the future development and help reduce regressions.

### Migration guide
- Replace the `hasChildren` property for tree items with `isFolder`.
- Replace the `canDropOnItemWithChildren` property on tree environment components or tree components with `canDropOnFolder`.
- Replace the `canDropOnItemWithoutChildren` property on tree environment components or tree components with `canDropOnNonFolder`.
- The upgrade of React to 18 should not require any changes on your end.
- If you are using custom interaction managers and want to benefit from the improved "select up to" functionality,
  replace `actions.selectUpTo()` with `actions.selectUpTo(!e.ctrlKey)` in the `onClick` handler.
- If you are overwriting CSS styles for rct-specific classes, replace `hasChildren` with `isFolder` in the class names.
