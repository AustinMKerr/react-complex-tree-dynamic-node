# Featureset revertion to the state of 2.3.6

I've noticed that I've accidentally been pushing a few experimental releases that were meant to be released
as prerelease under the "Latest" tag in NPM. This reverts the latest release to the state of 2.3.6, the last
proper "latest" release. Prereleases will from now on be released under the "prerelease" tag in NPM.
